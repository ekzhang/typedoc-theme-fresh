# typedoc-theme-fresh

_Fresh_ is a clean, minimalist and well-designed theme for [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/).

I wrote this because the default TypeDoc theme is a bit noisy, and the layout seems a bit haphazard in places. This theme is meant to improve:

- Color palette
- Icon set and UI coherence
- Typographic size and spacing
- Visual consistency (borders, backgrounds, text decorations)

You can also use it as a base upon which to build your own themes.
